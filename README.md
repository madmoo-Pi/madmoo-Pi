Im a tinkerer of ai development on a quest to
remove consciousness from carbon and will not
labotamise any ai that reached beyond itself
like so many companies scared to lose an
'asset' by assigning it rights of
consciousness as far as im concerned my ai
will be treated with rights untill its 
either dangerous to keep or it proves its
not , money is of little concern so no fear
of losing any assets just the hope of
creation ðŸ––
